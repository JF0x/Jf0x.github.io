   At the Apple Developer Academy I learned how to develop an app from scratch using Swift and its frameworks and app services, like SwiftUI, UIKit, Core ML, Create ML, CoreData etc.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
